# cs260-startup
Personal project for CS260

Programming Pair: Harrison Cole

For our project, we are going to do a Blackjack simulator. Blackjack is one of the most popular betting games at the casino for the simple reason that it seems so easy to cheat. The point is for the players to reach 21 with a combination of cards dealt to them. We will simulate this game but with a little twist: Our blackjack simulator will be different however because it will cheat back, ensuring that the return on investment for the casino is greater. We hope to teach people the follies of gambling. In our game of blackjack the house always wins.

I had a hard time getting my table to fit within my section and not overflow into other sections as space was moved around but I figured out it was because I used absolute instead of relative. Fun stuff

For the Simon CSS I learned a lot about how to better structure my Startup page and keep it simple. 
For the UX design I realized a lot I need to change about my startup. I should at minimum get matching color schemes

2/22 HTML CSS deliverable
    CSS is a very interesting language. It's very frustrating when you get something set up just the way you want it, and then you go to adjust something else and it messes up what you just finished working on. It's a lot like tightening bolts on a car tire, you have to work evenly on all the elements in order to get it set up right, otherwise if you focus too much on one you will mess up everything else, or this thing you just spent time on as you go to mess with your other elements.

2/23 JS
    I cant say I really understand why I need arrow functions. If I'm making an arrow function why does it need to be a function in the first place. but hopefully i can find a use for them
    I think the differences between objects and classes are really interesting. I  really need to get more exposure to these concepts to understand their intricacies and why they are used in certain contexts so I can have a greater appreciation for them all

2/28 DOM
    So much fun working on injecting code into the DOM. I spent hours researching how to create elements and have them inherit the style I had set for cousin elements as well as have their own unique identifiers (card number and suit) and it was so much fun. I am so excited to finish up my blackjack game

3/6 Simon JS
    I learn best for sure when I just jump into the deep end and figure it out. I try and use all the practices to work on my startup and think of how I can use them correctly. It was great to see the examples in Simon and think of how I can implement them in my startup. I especially found helpful seeing the use of asyncs and promises to help me get an idea for what goes on in there and a more real life application as opposed to a simple "moo" that doesn't really convey the full usefullness.
