# cs260-startup
Personal project for CS260

Programming Pair: Harrison Cole

For our project, we are going to do a Blackjack simulator. Blackjack is one of the most popular betting games at the casino for the simple reason that it seems so easy to cheat. The point is for the players to reach 21 with a combination of cards dealt to them. We will simulate this game but with a little twist: Our blackjack simulator will be different however because it will cheat back, ensuring that the return on investment for the casino is greater. We hope to teach people the follies of gambling. In our game of blackjack the house always wins.

I had a hard time getting my table to fit within my section and not overflow into other sections as space was moved around but I figured out it was because I used absolute instead of relative. Fun stuff

For the Simon CSS I learned a lot about how to better structure my Startup page and keep it simple. 
For the UX design I realized a lot I need to change about my startup. I should at minimum get matching color schemes
